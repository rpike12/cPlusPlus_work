This project is an anagram algorithm. The user enters the size of the word they would like (between 3 and 8 letters long), and the program returns 
a random word of that size. The program then finds every possible word, from the word file, that can be made with all of the letters from the 
randomly selected word. Then, the program returns all of the possible anagrams that can be made. If the word has no anagrams, a message 
appears that says the word has no anagrams.
